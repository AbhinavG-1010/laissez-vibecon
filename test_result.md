Test confirmed: 1) Agent lookup from Supabase working correctly 2) Agent URL proxy attempted (logs show 'Agent URL proxy error') 3) LLM fallback triggered automatically 4) Webhook returns {ok: true} in all scenarios 5) Backend logs confirm proper error handling and fallback execution.

    message: "✅ LLM FALLBACK FUNCTIONALITY TESTING COMPLETE - Successfully verified new Telegram webhook proxy functionality with LLM fallback as requested in review. All three test scenarios passed: 1) Non-existent agent URL triggers LLM fallback (GPT-5-mini with Emergent LLM key) - confirmed via backend logs showing 'Agent URL proxy error' 2) Agent lookup correctly queries Supabase for bot_token to get agent URL - verified 23 agents found including test bot 3) Webhook endpoint accessibility confirmed - POST /api/telegram-webhook/{bot_token} returns 200 OK. The system properly attempts agent URL contact, fails gracefully, and uses LLM fallback while maintaining proper response format {ok: true} to Telegram."
